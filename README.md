First create a folder named "_img" inside "WebFormFileUploader" - this is to store saved images.

This project was created using the free Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2010 Express.

This is a very basic file uploader using JavaScript, HTML5, VB.NET and Generic Handler. 

It uploads files one-by-one. There are still bits that need to be implemented such as JS Validation, CSS to show delete button on gallery, make component re-useable & general refactoring. 

Tested on Chrome 83 and IE 11.
